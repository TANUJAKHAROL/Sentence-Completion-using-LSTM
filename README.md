# Sentence Completion using LSTM

This project demonstrates sentence completion using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for its ability to model sequential data. In this particular application, an LSTM model is trained to predict and complete sentences based on input text.

## Overview

Sentence completion involves predicting the next words or phrases in a given sentence. The LSTM model used here learns from a dataset of text sequences and is capable of generating coherent completions based on the context provided by the preceding words.

## Key Features

- LSTM model trained on text data for sentence completion.
- Generates probable sentence continuations based on input text.
- Allows customization of model parameters and training data.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0)
- NumPy
- (Optional) Jupyter Notebook for running example notebooks
